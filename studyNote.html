		<h3>mysql &&useSSL=false</h3>
		<p class="question">Console show this warning:
			Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification is
			not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+
			requirements SSL connection must be established by default if
			explicit option isn't set. For compliance with existing applications
			not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'.
			You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or
			set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate
			verification.</p>
		<p class="answer">i add "&useSSL=false" to jdbc.Url</p>
